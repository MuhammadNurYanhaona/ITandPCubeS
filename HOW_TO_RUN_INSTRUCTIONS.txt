Note that to generate executables from IT source codes you have to take the following steps.

1. First, write a valid IT task or program, of course.
2. Second, get or write a PCubeS description of the machine where you want to run your code.
3. Third, write a mapping description file depicting how LPSes (logical processing spaces) 
   of IT source are mapped to PPSes (physical processing spaces) of the target machine.

Examples of all these are available in MultiCoreBackEnd/samples directory.

Once you have all of the above you have to compile and generate the executable using the 
following steps.

1. First, generate the IT compiler by simply issuing "make" command on any backend directory
   such as MultiCoreBackEnd (which is the only backend we have now up until Feb 17, 2015).
   The default target of make is to generate the compiler. In case make fails, do a "make clean"
   first to ensure that this is not a temporary failure.
2. After that, you will have the compiler 'icc' on the backend directory. Then compile your
   own source code by using that compiler as follows
   
   ./icc $source_code $pcubes_file $mapping_file

   You will have target code generated in the build directory of your back-end compiler. If 
   the compilation fails then probably you do not have a build directory; thereby create it
   and try again.
3. Then, if compilation succeeds then invoke "make build" to generate an executable for the 
   target platform for your IT source code. This time the executable will be in the bin
   directory of your backend. Again, if compilation fails then probably we do not have a bin
   directory; thus create it and try again. This time it should work.
4. Finally run your executable.
