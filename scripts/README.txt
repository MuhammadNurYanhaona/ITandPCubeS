Some of the scripts in this directory may not be executable from here directly. In those
scripts, the assumption is that you are executing them from some other directory, and
violating that assumption may lead to many file not found exceptions. Most of the time
the assumption in such a case is that you are executing the script from one step above,
i.e., the project's root directory.

If you face some failures related to 'file not found' or 'cannot create directory/file'
then examine the script you are trying to execute.
