/* The idea of a confinement of communication is that it represents a location in the parts distribution
 * hierarchy of the underlying data structure such that the parts underneath the confinement should be
 * synchronized with one another depending on their data sharing characteristics. Individual parts may be
 * residing in different segments or within a single segments. Their physical location will effect how
 * data should be moved from one part to another but not the content that should be moved.
 *
 * Note that for a single data synchronization need there might be one or more confinements per segment.
 * All of these confinements will be in the same LPS level that is determined by the nature of the data
 * dependency arc originating the synchronization need. Therefore, the broad picture is there will be a
 * confinement level per communication with one or more independent confinement roots.
 *
 * Note the the notion of confinement become applicable only after we validated that there is a need of
 * data movement due to some shared/overlapped data structure update. This is important to remember as
 * when multiple PPUs update regions of a single part then barrier or other forms of local sync primitives
 * are enough to synchronize all PPUs before they proceed further.
