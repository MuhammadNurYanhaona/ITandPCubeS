Each test case has a main function.
The main function is hidden by renaming it into mainXXX.
This is done so that we can make a build with only a single test case enabled.
When you want to test a feature, just remove the suffix from the main function then build and run it in eclipse.
Once you are done, rename the main function again to include the previous suffix.
