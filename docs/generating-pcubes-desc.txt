PCubeS-Description------------------------------------------------------------------------
To generate PCubeS descriptions for your target execution platforms, take the help of any 
hardware description manual or operating system files. In linux, you can get additional 
aid from the following two locations to get enough information about writing a good PCubeS 
description
   a) /proc/cpuinfo file for processor information
   b) /sys/devices/system/cpu/ directory to get information about cache hierarchies

Your PCubeS description file should have the extension .ml

Core-Numbering----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Different hardware vendors assign physical IDs to the hardware cores differently. So a 
core numbering file is needed, in addition to the PCubeS description file, to generate 
executables tuned for a target backend. To generate the core numbering file, one needs to 
parse the content of the /proc/cpuinfo file using the following command

  cat $CPU-Info-File | grep -e processor -e "physical id" -e "core id" | paste - - -

Your core numbering file should have the extension .cn

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Both the PCubeS description and core numbering files should be placed within a single 
directory. Further, do not place more than one hardware's description in that directory.
Have separate directories for your different target machines.

Finally, several example descriptions are given in the ../machine-models directory
