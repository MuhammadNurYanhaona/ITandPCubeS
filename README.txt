Install/uninstall instructions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use the installer script 'installer' for both install and uninstall the backend IT compilers.
Before installing the backend compilers though, the compilers need to be configured properly.
The properties files are in the config directory.

Directory structure of the project
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. compiler-parts: has the source codes for different phases of the front-end compiler. This 
   might be useful for someone interested in investigating the different states of the 
   intermediate representation of an IT source code
2. compilers: has source codes for fully implemented IT backend compilers
3. config: has properties files used to configure the backend compilers and the executable 
   generated by them
4. docs: has instructions for running codes, generating PCubeS descriptions of machines, etc.
5. helper-projects: has some eclipse C++ projects used during constructing and debugging the
   backend compilers; in particular it has a project containing reference hand-written codes 
   to do performance comparison against IT codes
6. machine-models: has some sample hardware's PCubeS descriptions
7. samples: has sample IT codes for experiment
8. scripts: has some bash scripts used by the installer
9. tools: has tools that can be used to generate random text/binary data files, compare file
   contents, etc; tools in this directory may come in handy during performance experiments
