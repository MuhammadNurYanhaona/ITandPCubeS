/* This header file specifies all classes related to handling of operating memory of different data structures
   within an IT code (by operating memory, we understand the actual memory locations where access and updates
   take place during the execution of the IT program). We store parts of different data structures as they are
   needed by a particular segmented-PPU. In other word, the data is owned by the PPU and LPUs are constructed
   by passing them the appropriate part references to different data structure. This approach is used to take
   into account that many LPUs may share the same piece of data due to replication and we should avoid storing
   same data piece multiple times.

   operates on the part container instead of using it as a mechanism to determine what part to return. We adopt
   this current strategy as the list based part allocation mechanism was developed earlier and the efficient search 
   mechanism has been developed after we faced severe performance and memory problems in straightforward process.
   We did not want to change all the dependencies of the data-part-list construct; rather we only wanted to
