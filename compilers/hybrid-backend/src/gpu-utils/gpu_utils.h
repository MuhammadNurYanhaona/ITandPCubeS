// Given a set of index ranges to be iterated by an warp that wants to distribute the work among its thread, 
// this routines provides the loop iteration start indexes and step sizes for the threads. Distribution of
// iterations to threads of a warp has a great impact on the performance of a CUDA kernel as a poor choice 
// may lead to loss of parallelism, and increasing bank conflicts and non-coalesced global memory accessess.
// An ideal distribution of iteration indexes should be context sensitive to account for the aforementioned
// issues. For that starter, we adopt the strategy of distributing the lowest range that can support enough
// parallel work for all the threads of a warp.
