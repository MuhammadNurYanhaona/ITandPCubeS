1. Determine if array dimensions are set properly in the initialize sections
2. Put dangling arrows from dynamic computation stages to nearest static 
   spaces if they are last to modify some data structures	
3. Annotate communication arcs to reflect partitions and replications
4. Put synchronization markers in place 
5. Update syntax to support iterating over manually created ranges
6. Current implemention of loop iteration generation is not translating any
   loop in the initializing section properly (Jan 16, 2015 status) due to the
   assumption about default prefix and suffixes to be added to such a loop
   iteration's variables which works for compute stages but is not appropriate
   for initialize section. We need to fix this issue. It should not involve
   some minor refactoring and including a tag in code generation that add 
   different prefixes based on the code been translated at the time
