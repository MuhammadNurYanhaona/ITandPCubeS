/* This library has LPU count and partition range determining routines for the partition functions currently supported
 * in IT. Although we have the routines for the same purpose already available for host LPUs, we need to develop equi-
 * valent versions for the GPU LPUs for two reasons. First, the data structures used in the host has member functions
 * used during the count and range determination that are not accessible from the GPU code, requiring the routines have 
 * simpler alternative arguments. Second, the count and range determining functions themselves are not accessible from
 * the GPU as they are not, and cannot be declared, device functions.

// TODO: note that the current implementations of these routines assume that the dimension being partitioned increases
// in the positive direction. This restriction needs to be relaxed in the future as IT also supports dimension ranges
// that advances in the negative direction, i.e., starting at a larger index and ending to a smaller index.
